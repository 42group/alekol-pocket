# Alekol Pocket
This project is completely inspired by [Alekol](https://github.com/theovgl/alekol-42), a Discord bot that automatically add or remove a role whether you are logged at 42 school.

Instead of using Discord, this project uses a ESP8266 microcontroller with a screen to display the names of your connected friends.
